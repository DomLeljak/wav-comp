# wav-comp

An example project intended as a learning experience.

Generates a dataset following a trigonometric function with noise, and implements a network with a sinusoidal activation function with trainable parameters in a regression procedure.

Based in part on "*Taming the waves: sine as activation function in deep neural networks*" [[link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sks3zF9eg)].
